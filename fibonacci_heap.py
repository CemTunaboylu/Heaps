""" 
For priority Queue operations, consisting of a collection of heap-ordered-trees. It has a better amortized running time then binary heap and binomial heap.
For the Fibonacci heap, the find-minimum operation takes constant (O(1)) amortized time. The insert and decrease key operations also work in constant amortized time.
Deleting an element (most often used in the special case of deleting the minimum element) works in O(log n) amortized time, where n is the size of the heap
